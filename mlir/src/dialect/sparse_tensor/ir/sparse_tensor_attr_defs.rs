// Sparse tensor encoding attribute.
/**
An attribute to encode TACO-style information on sparsity properties of tensors. The encoding is eventually used by a **sparse compiler** pass to generate sparse code fully automatically for all tensor expressions that involve tensors with a sparse encoding. Compiler passes that run before this sparse compiler pass need to be aware of the semantics of tensor types with such an encoding.

The attribute consists of the following fields.

- Dimension level type for each dimension of a tensor type:
    - **dense** : dimension is dense, all entries along this dimension
      are stored
    - **compressed** : dimension is sparse, only nonzeros along this dimensions
      are stored
    - **singleton** : dimension stores individual indices with no siblings
  By default, each dimension level types has the property of being unique
  (no duplicates at that level) and ordered (indices appear sorted at that
  level). The following two suffixes can be used to make the last two
  dimension level types not-unique (duplicates may appear) and not-ordered
  (indices may appear unsorted).
    - **-nu** : not unique
    - **-no** : not ordered
  Currently, these suffixes, is present, should appear in this order.
  In the future, we may introduce many more dimension level types and
  properties, and separate specifying the two completely rather than
  using this suffix mechanism.

- An optional dimension ordering on the indices of this tensor type. Unlike
  dense storage, most sparse storage schemes do not provide fast random
  access.  This affine map specifies the order of dimensions that should be
  supported by the sparse storage scheme. For example, for a 2-d tensor,
  `(i, j) -> (i, j)` requests row-wise storage and `(i, j) -> (j, i)`
  requests column-wise storage.  By default, an identify mapping is used,
  which implies that the original indices directly correspond to stored
  indices.

- An optional higher-ordering mapping from the original index space of
  the tensor to a higher-order index space, used to define block-sparse
  storage or ELL (jagged diagonal) storage. For example, for a 2-d tensor,
  the mapping `(i, j) -> (i floordiv 2, j floordiv 3, i mod 2, j mod 3)`
  imposes an higher-order partitioning into 2x3 blocks along the matrix
  layout. A dimension ordering can be used to define a desired ordering
  on this higher-order index space. Likewise, the dimension level types
  define dense or compressed storage along this higher-order index space.
  For block-sparse, blocks are typically stored with compression while
  dense storage is used within each block (although hybrid schemes are
  possible as well). The higher-order mapping also provides a notion of
  "counting a dimension", where every stored element with the same index
  is mapped to a new slice. For instance, ELL storage of a 2-d tensor can
  be defined with the mapping `(i, j) -> (#i, i, j)` using the notation
  of [Chou20]. Lacking the `#` symbol in MLIR's affine mapping, we use
  a free symbol `c` to define such counting, together with a constant
  that denotes the number of resulting slices. For example, the mapping
  `(i, j)[c] -> (c * 3 * i, i, j)` with the first two higher-order indices
  stored dense and the innermost compressed denotes ELL storage with
  three jagged diagonals that count the dimension `i`.

  TODO: introduce a real counting symbol to MLIR's mapping, since an
        expression like 3*c*i has no direct interpretation?

- The required bit width for "pointer" storage (integral offsets into
  the sparse storage scheme). A narrow width reduces the memory footprint
  of overhead storage, as long as the width suffices to define the total
  required range (viz. the maximum number of stored entries over all indirection
  dimensions). The choices are `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, or, the default, `0` to
  indicate the native bit width.

- The required bit width for "index" storage (elements of the coordinates of
  stored entries). A narrow width reduces the memory footprint of overhead
  storage, as long as the width suffices to define the total required range
  (viz. the maximum value of each tensor index over all dimensions). The
  choices are `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, or, the default, `0` to indicate a
  native bit width.
